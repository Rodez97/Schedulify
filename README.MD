# Schedulify (WIP)

Schedulify is a project I created for the purpose of simplifying the creation of schedules for teams in a straightforward and free manner. There is an option to export the schedule in either EXCEL or PDF format, and it utilizes Firestore as the database and Firebase Auth for user authentication.

## Installation

To install all Schedulify dependencies, use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm).

```bash
npm install 
```
